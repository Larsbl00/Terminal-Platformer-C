# Terminal-Platformer-C
This is a platformer programmed in c. This entire project is meant as a way to improve my C skills. 
This game is developed in a linux environment, and as of now I do not feel like making it cross platform. 


# Game Controls
```c
'a' : Move left
'd' : Move right
' ' : Jump
```
* Note: Keys can be found in the player.h file as defines

# Game Mechanics
This is a rather simple platformer, move from the start to end. These, per default, are the right and left side respectively.
